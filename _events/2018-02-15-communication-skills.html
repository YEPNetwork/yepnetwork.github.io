One of the most respected motivational speakers- Les Brown, said: “Effective communication is the number one tool to succeed in any endeavor.” More than we would like to admit, we all communicate at home, in the neighbor, work, and marketplaces.The question is whether our communication is effective or not; whether we are getting the results we’re looking for or not.

If your desire is to communicate better and get what you want and advance in life, your profession, and attain success in whatever you are doing right now, you need to attend this workshop.

In this worksshop, you will learn about what are effective communication skills, what types there are and where can you apply them, and differenct tools you can use to improve your communication.

The facilitator of this workshop is Dr. Assegid Habtewold, the author of ‘Soft Skills That Make or Break Your Success’. Effective communication is one of the soft skills that make or break your life, career, and/or business.
