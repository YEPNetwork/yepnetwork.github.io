<p> One in five adults, world-wide, is affected by mental health conditions. Aside from the actual illness, the stigma alone has proven to be toxic for those seeking help and treatment as it creates an environment of shame, fear, and silence. In efforts to break the stigma and address the taboo head on, YEP is hosting an interactive mental health forum. </p>
<p>The purpose of this event is to engage and inform the community of the various resources and services available to enhance wellness and/or recovery within the diaspora. Attendees will hear from panelists sharing their personal stories of success as they strengthen their mental states and from mental health experts.</p>
<p>The evening will begin with a panel discussion and then move into a breakout "de-stress" activity.</p>
<p> Attendees should use the hashtag: #4Mind4Body, to participate in May's Mental Health Awareness Month.</p>
