Recognizing the lack of effective networking platforms for young diverse Ethiopian professionals in the DMV area, Mesfin Getaneh founded YEP in Nov, 2010. As the President of YEP, Mesfin is responsible for directing its vision and management, overseeing the organizationâ€™s overall operations and expansion, and representing the organization with key stakeholders. Mesfin is currently a Patent Examiner in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Additionally, Mesfin has served on the board of directors of Ethiopian-American Engineers and Scientists (SEAES) at the US Patent and Trademark office, an organization dedicated to promoting the interests, aspirations, and professional excellence of Ethiopian-American Engineers and Scientists. Mesfin has also served as a mentor and tutor to high school and college students in Louisiana and Virginia. Moreover, in response to the most recent Horn of Africa famine, Mesfin was part of the founding team of HornLight, a website platform to share diverse, complex and nuanced narratives on the Horn of Africa, serving as head of Messaging. Mesfin holds a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering at the University of New Orleans (UNO). In college, Mesfin participated in multiple fellowships and published research papers in collaboration with his mentoring professors at Stanford, Purdue, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and Northwestern universities.
