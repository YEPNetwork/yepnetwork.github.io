<p>Personal and Professional Empowerment &nbsp;is about looking at who you are and becoming more aware of yourself as a unique individual. Personal empowerment involves developing the confidence and strength to set realistic goals and fulfil your potential.&nbsp;Everyone has strengths and weaknesses and a range of skills that are used in everyday situations, but all too often people remain unaware of, or undervalue, their true abilities.</p>
