## Nate Araya in his own words

### 1.	Being a part of the Ethiopian diaspora to me means....
That I am a part of a growing community of pioneers that have significant value to contribute within both Africa and the US. 

### 2.	Much of your work has revolved around exploring your identity as an Ethiopian-American, could you please elaborate on the importance/significance of exploring your identity as a first/second generation? How has this contributed to your overall growth and development? 
Much of my own personal research in exploring identity started with me facing and embracing the differences, disconnects and division I felt growing up as an Ethiopian-American in the US. As I began to face and embrace my difference, I became vulnerable and started to open up in sharing my story with others. As I shared my story with others, I began to notice that I wasn't alone. There are many people like me within the Ethiopian-American Diaspora that share the same problems. I have grown to understand that common problems lead to common purpose. There are many thinkers, doers and creators of the Ethiopian-American Diaspora that can add significant value in bridging an insurmountable gap between 2 different societies, cultures, countries and continents. 

### 3.	What advice would you give a younger you?
There is as much purpose within your weaknesses and failures as there is to your strengths and successes. Never let your failures go to your heart and never let your success go to your head. When it comes to failure, always know that your failures will lead to success if you embrace it and learn something from it. Learn to become friends with your flaws, fears and failure. There is purpose within your pain. Though pain and failure cannot be avoided, it can be endured and overcome.  

### 4.	What interest haven't you pursued, but have always wanted to and what draws you to it? 
I simply want to give Dr. Abiy Ahmed a big gursha on Bole road in Addis Ababa.
