## Helen Mesfin in her own words

### 1. Being apart of the Ethiopian diaspora to me means.

Being part of the Ethiopian diaspora to me means being part of a community that aspires to achieve,  to grow and to belong. It means sharing and celebrating the rich culture and diversity within our community with the world. It means showing strength and resilience against all odds as immigrants in our adopted land building a better future for the next generation. Our greater strength is our unity and our willingness to support and uplift one another, building bridges between our communities and our homeland.  It's being proud of heritage, owning who we are whatever our background or circumstances with a belief that we can do whatever we set our mind to because we can.  

### 2. What advice would you give a younger you?

I would tell my younger self to worry less. To travel the world and be more open to experiences and adventures.    Don't let anyone else's perception or opinion influence my choices.
I would tell her to practice gratitude each day to be able to appreciate whatever experiences I may be going through.   Have confidence in your abilities. Be bold to act on your dreams as big as they are, even though there is a chance you may fail, because you will get up.

### 3. What interest haven't you pursued, but have always wanted to and what draws you to it?

I would love to take dance classes! Salsa, African, Hip hop, Jazz you name it I want and dream about it. I just haven’t made the time for it.  Moving our bodies to a song we love is beautiful and brings joy. To me dancing represents freedom, it’s great for physical fitness and lifting your spirt. It’s a way to express myself while having fun. So, one of these days I will make my self register for a class…soon! 

### 4. What is your message on International Women's Day and Women's History Month for your fellow Ethiopians and Ethiopian-Americans?

My message for my fellow Ethiopians and Ethiopian Americans is to know deep in their heart that they matter. Their thoughts, opinions, ideas and dreams matter. Everyone of us have something to contribute to our families, our community and the world at large. Believe in yourself and your abilities to pursue whatever your life goal is. In Ethiopia, small things like encouraging a daughter to find her dreams, pursue education or a skill and helping her achieve them is essential.  Treating all children equal boy or a girl and helping her develop self-confidence by allowing her to make important life decisions is critical. When a woman feels safe, empowered and valued it impacts society positively.Honor yourself and treat yourself with respect and that will send a clear message for others to do the same for you. Speak up and let your voice be heard. Live your life on your terms, don’t worry about what people think or say. You have a gift, cultivate and grow it to benefit yourself and others.
